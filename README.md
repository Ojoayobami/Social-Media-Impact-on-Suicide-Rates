# Social-Media-Impact-on-Suicide-Rates
The impact of social media on suicide is a complex and multifaceted issue that has garnered significant attention in recent years. As platforms for communication, connection, and content sharing, social media has revolutionized how people interact. 
However, its effects on mental health and suicidal behavior have become a pressing concern, particularly among adolescents and young adults.

The crucial problem is the comparison culture that social media has created, where people are regularly exposed to carefully selected and romanticized depictions of other peopleâ€™s lives, which can lead to low self-esteem, feelings of inadequacy, and sadness, which can precipitate or exacerbate depression and suicidal thoughts for those who are vulnerable. Additionally, some social media platforms unintentionally expose users to harmful content, such as content that glorifies suicide or self-harm, which can have a negative impact on those who are at risk.

Additionally, excessive social media use can result in addiction and have a detrimental impact on mental health. Spending too much time on the internet can take the place of in-person social interactions, leading to emotional detachment and loneliness, two major factors linked to depression.

RECOMMENDATION

More Job Opportunities on Social Media Platform

Facebook and Twitter regulations should limit the way personal property is displayed. Adopt strong content moderation policies, use AI to flag harmful content proactively, and give direct access to mental health resources. The only goal of these regulations should be to create job opportunities.

Educational Content and Self Development on Social Media Platform should be encouraged

Support initiatives that foster inclusive and supportive online spaces where individuals feel safe sharing their struggles without fear of judgment or harassment. Educational platforms and self-development courses and materials should be at a subsidized rate so people can be empowered to get job opportunities.

Improve Digital Literacy

Users, particularly young people, should be taught how to use social media responsibly and how to assess the information they take in. Programs to raise digital awareness can be implemented in communities and schools.

Support and incentives should also be provided to help poor or average people establish themselves in business or careers.
